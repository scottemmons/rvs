*__Abstract__*:
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is typically tackled with value-based TD methods. However, a number of approaches have been proposed that aim to simplify offline RL by reducing it to weighted, filtered, or conditional behavioral cloning problems. These methods coerce suboptimal data into a form that allows supervised learning methods to acquire optimal policies. For example, any experience is optimal for learning to reach the final state in that experience. However, it remains unclear which ingredients are essential for such methods to work well, and when these methods outperform value-based approximate dynamic programming algorithms. These methods, which we collectively refer to as reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS), involve a number of design decisions, such as policy architectures and how the conditioning variable is constructed. Through extensive experiments, this paper studies the importance of these design decisions. The most important design decisions boil down to carefully choosing model capacity (e.g., via regularization or architecture) and choosing which information to condition on (e.g., goals or rewards). Our experiments find that more complex design choices, such as the large sequence models and value-based weighting schemes used in some prior works, are generally not necessary. Our results show that carefully designed RvS methods can attain results that match or exceed the best prior methods across a range of different offline RL benchmarks, including datasets with little or no optimal data. Our results help to identify the limits of current RvS methods and identify some important open problems.
